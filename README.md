# Electrical Engineering Project : Design and Simulation of a Fast DC EV Recharging Station
A fast DC recharging station design, model, &amp; simulation is presented for multiple EVs supporting G2V &amp; V2G mode. MATLAB/Simulink tool is used with each component designed using standard formulae. Constant current (CC) & voltage (CV) control is used. Power quality is maintained and results obtained prove the effectiveness of proposed model.
